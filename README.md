HOW TO RUN THIS MESS:

1. Run getDisgenetData.py: it will connect to disgenet and get you the list of genes you want. The result will be printed on the output. Save the output to a file called listOfGenes.tsv . File must be in the same directory as the rest of the programs. Output will be about 15 lines

The rest of the scripts in the directory are sample scripts
